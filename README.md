ESlint and Prettier to help you save the day and maybe a small bit of your sanity*

What the What?

    ESlint is a way to carry in new dependencies into your coding language; not just used for javaScript. It allows you to write code then hit "cmd+s" to inplement new rules which can be varied by technology and project. It is free, easy to use, and incredibly easy to understand. In addition, it is simple to install.

Should I use this or nah?

    Totes use it bruh. Super dope. Super chill. Good vibes. 
    
    Only enhances your coding ability by identifying and offering suggestions to slop code. Ideal for a n00b such as myself.

    I found this very useful over the weekend when I was redoing assignments, or touching them up. Instead of looking for individual errors, I installed ESlint and the Prettier plugin. It would pinpoint sloppy code and suggest fixes. I currently implemented this into our most recent weekend assignment, the To-Do List. I realized a major rource of my frustration was stemming from simple typos from fast typing or from copying/pasting boiler plate from project to project. ESlint will help identify anything from poor naming conventions, mismatched variables, improper use of "let" vs "const" vs "var" etc. There are dozens on dozens of ways to tailor the extension and plugin to suit your project.

Cool beans but how?
I found a youtube video on how to install these techs and used this custom made repo this dev had put together which I like a lot since it came withe AirBnB styling dependency right out of the gate. Installing it properly was probably the most challenging part but not all that hard or different from installing via terminal.

    I find myself using both ESlint and Prettier going forward and am super-dooper happy my friend told me about it.
